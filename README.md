# logicmonitorscripts

This is a collection of scripts (.bash, .sql, .ps1) that can be used to collect data from various systems in order to display stats in a monitoring platform such as Logicmonitor. 

They have been used as Logicmonitor DataSources in a production environment.

All scripts return data in a numerical tabular/matrix format as keypairs ("normal datapoints" in Logicmonitor)

Most scripts are built to work against the out of the box Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2 database. They ought to work in newer versions also. Some scripts are generic OS related. The filenames will give an indication and comments will define further.
